Tastytrade Python SDK
=====================

A simple, reverse-engineered, sync/async SDK for Tastytrade built on their (now mostly public) API. This will allow you to create trading algorithms for whatever strategies you may have quickly and painlessly in Python.

.. tip::
   Want to see the SDK in action? Check out `tastytrade-cli <https://github.com/tastyware/tastytrade-cli>`_, a CLI for Tastytrade that showcases many of the SDK's features.

.. note::
   Do you use TradeStation? We're building a `brand-new SDK <https://github.com/tastyware/tradestation>`_ for TS users, with many of the same features!
