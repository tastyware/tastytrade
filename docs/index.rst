Tastytrade Python SDK
=====================

A simple, reverse-engineered, sync/async SDK for Tastytrade built on their (now mostly public) API. This will allow you to create trading algorithms for whatever strategies you may have quickly and painlessly in Python.

.. tip::
   Want to see the SDK in action? Check out `tastytrade-cli <https://github.com/tastyware/tastytrade-cli>`_, a CLI for Tastytrade that showcases many of the SDK's features.

.. note::
   Want to build an advanced trading system? Check out `streaQ <https://github.com/tastyware/streaq>`_, an async job queuing library for Python that's perfect for complex applications!
