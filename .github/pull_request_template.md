## Pre-merge checklist
- [ ] Code formatted correctly (check with `make lint`)
- [ ] Code implemented for both sync and async
- [ ] Passing tests locally (check with `make test`, make sure you have `TT_USERNAME`, `TT_PASSWORD`, and `TT_ACCOUNT` environment variables set)
- [ ] New tests added (if applicable)

Please note that, in order to pass the tests, you'll need to set up your Tastytrade credentials as repository secrets on your local fork. Read more at CONTRIBUTING.md.
